# Weather-Base
The transmitting base of my MicroBit weather station, made with MakeCode and Python.

## Setup
**1. Set up the station**<br>
Put the microbit in a roofed environment, where no water can get in, make sure it is away from  big walls and that wind can come through and come in contact with the microbit, otherwise no temperature will be read.
<br><br>
**2. Set up the receiver**<br>
Follow the steps on [weather-controller](https://github.com/rafaelsoley/weather-controller)<br>
Once both microbits are turned on and with the programming set up, you should see the blue light turn on in the controller microbit.
<br><br>
**3. Set up the frequency (OPTIONAL)**<br>
For the base project, the frequency is 255. Feel free to change this, as long as you change it in both the Base and the Controller.

**4. Edit the code to your liking (OPTIONAL)**<br>
Feel like the code needs some improvements? Feel free to make your edits, and if you want that implemented, fill in a pull request, and I will happily merge the codes.
